# 7 Numpy_ Pandas
--------------------

Pandas is an open-source, BSD-licensed library written in Python Language. Pandas provide high-performance, fast, easy-to-use data structures, and data analysis tools for manipulating numeric data and time series. 

Numpy is the fundamental library of Python, used to perform scientific computing. It provides high-performance multidimensional arrays and tools to deal with them. 
A Numpy array is a grid of values (of the same type) that are indexed by a tuple of positive integers, Numpy arrays are fast, easy to understand, and give users the right to perform calculations across arrays.


Exercise 1: 
----------

Create a numpy array containing the numbers from 1 to 10, and then reshape it to a 2x5 matrix.

Exercise 2: 
----------

Create a numpy array containing the numbers from 1 to 20, and then extract the elements between the 5th and 15th index.

Exercise 3: 
-----------

Create a Pandas series with the following data: {'apples': 3, 'bananas': 2, 'oranges': 1}. Then, add a new item to the series with the key 'pears' and the value 4.

Exercise 4: 
------------

Create a dataframe with the following columns: name, age, and gender. The dataframe should have 10 rows of data.

Exercise 5: 
-----------
Add a new column to the data frame created in question 1, called occupation. The values for this column should be Programmer, Manager, and Analyst, corresponding to the rows in the dataframe.

Exercise 6:
-----------
Select the rows of the dataframe where the age is greater than or equal to 30.

Exercise 7: 
-----------
Convert this dataframe to a csv file and read that csv file, finally display the contents.
